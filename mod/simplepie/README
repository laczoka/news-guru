Widget Title
---------------------------
To change the widget title, edit the language file (en.php) and change the string simplepie:widget from Blog to whatever you desire.


Proxy Server
----------------------------
If your site is going through a proxy server to get to the feeds, you may want to increase the timeout on the feeds (though this is unlikely as the default timeout is 10 seconds). You can do this by editing simplepie/views/default/widgets/feed_reader/view.php. There you can just uncomment the line $feed->set_timeout(20);
